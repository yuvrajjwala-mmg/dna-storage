      "We are building the first Ethereum powered network dedicated to DNA computing and storage. Our mission is to unite the security of decentralized infrastructure with the permanence of molecular storage creating a system that can hold humanity's most important data far beyond the lifespan of any device or platform. We aim to accelerate adoption by bridging the gap between advanced biotechnology and the blockchain economy giving global communities access to tools that were once locked behind lab doors.",

    description:
      "A future where data no longer dies. Where archives discoveries and cultural milestones are preserved in strands of DNA for millennia. Where scientific breakthroughs are computed at a molecular scale.\n\nIn this future DNA is the ultimate medium for permanence. Immune to obsolescence resilient to decay and accessible anywhere on the planet. Ethereum provides the trust layer ensuring this power remains open verifiable and community governed.\n\nWe are not just preserving the past. We are building the infrastructure that will carry civilization's knowledge into the far future.",

      'The Genesis Era begins with establishing the foundational layer. The technology stack the partnerships and the community that will drive DNA computing into the mainstream.\n\nOur immediate priority is to create a network that proves DNA storage and computation can be accessed verified and coordinated through Ethereum. As capabilities expand from encoding short sequences to archiving massive datasets the ecosystem will evolve into a fully operational molecular computing network.',
